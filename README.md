# Flask-Okta-Vault-Auth
This project involves the development of a Flask-based web application that leverages OpenID Connect (OIDC) for user authentication with Okta as the identity provider. The application securely manages sensitive configurations using HashiCorp Vault, ensuring that access credentials like Okta's client ID and client secret are stored safely.
